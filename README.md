- 👋 Hi, I’m [@Saif64](https://github.com/Saif64)
- 👀 I’m interested in mostly coding, problem solving and building new softwares 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at Brac University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many open source projects and want to build my own open source project so that I can help as much people as I can.
- 📫 Reach me through [@Muntasir Mahmud Saif](https://www.facebook.com/muntasir.m.saif)
- I take initiative extremely well. I enjoy creating new websites and applications and solving challenges. I'm not required to work up to the due date. Furthermore, I excel at working under pressure. My sole passion is to work as a software developer. In the upcoming 4-5 years, I hope to envision myself as a team leader of are spectable organization.
